# Intro
This is my Python Basics Learning. I am currently re-learning it to enhance my skills to start my transition to AI/ML.

# Reasoning
I am currently a Software Developer with expertise in WordPress development, and even though I love it, I don't feel challenged and not using my full potential.
This will also help encourage others who are similar to me to keep trying, even when it's too hard.

My background is IT, Computer Science learning is on a different level to me, so I am really challenging myself.

I will have my Python Projects stored here as well.

Have a wonderful day! ðŸ˜ƒ
